        <p class="biography-header__text">
            Avram Noam Chomsky (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, social critic, and political activist.
            Sometimes called "the father of modern linguistics", Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science.
            He is Laureate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona and Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),
            and is the author of more than 150 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media.
            Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.

            Born to Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City.
            He studied at the University of Pennsylvania.
            During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955.
            That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played a major role in remodeling the study of language.
            From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study.
            He created or co-created the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program.
            Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.

            An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose
            to national attention for his anti-war essay "The Responsibility of Intellectuals". Becoming associated with the New Left,
            he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon's Enemies List. While expanding his work in
            linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistics wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman,
            Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor.
            His defense of unconditional freedom of speech, including that of Holocaust denial, generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the 1980s.
            Since retiring from active teaching at MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement.
            Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017.

            One of the most cited scholars alive, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields.
            He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences,
            contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind.
            In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S.
            foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media.
            Chomsky and his ideas are highly influential in the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements.
            Life and basic ideas
            Born into a middle-class Jewish family, Chomsky attended an experimental elementary school in which he was encouraged to develop his own interests and talents through self-directed learning.
            When he was 10 years old, he wrote an editorial for his school newspaper lamenting the fall of Barcelona in the Spanish Civil War and the rise of fascism in Europe.
            His research then and during the next few years was thorough enough to serve decades later as the basis of “Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship” (1969),
            Chomsky’s critical review of a study of the period by the historian Gabriel Jackson.

            When he was 13 years old, Chomsky began taking trips by himself to New York City,
            where he found books for his voracious reading habit and made contact with a thriving working-class Jewish intellectual community.
            Discussion enriched and confirmed the beliefs that would underlie his political views throughout his life:
            that all people are capable of comprehending political and economic issues and making their own decisions on that basis;
            that all people need and derive satisfaction from acting freely and creatively and from associating with others;
            and that authority—whether political, economic, or religious—that cannot meet a strong test of rational justification is illegitimate.
            According to Chomsky’s anarchosyndicalism, or libertarian socialism, the best form of political organization is one in which all people have a
            maximal opportunity to engage in cooperative activity with others and to take part in all decisions of the community that affect them.

            In 1945, at the age of 16, Chomsky entered the University of Pennsylvania but found little to interest him.
            After two years he considered leaving the university to pursue his political interests, perhaps by living on a kibbutz.
            He changed his mind, however, after meeting the linguist Zellig S.
            Harris, one of the American founders of structural linguistics, whose political convictions were similar to Chomsky’s.
            Chomsky took graduate courses with Harris and, at Harris’s recommendation, studied philosophy with Nelson Goodman and Nathan Salmon and mathematics with Nathan Fine,
            who was then teaching at Harvard University. In his 1951 master’s thesis, The Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew,
            and especially in The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (LSLT), written while he was a junior fellow at Harvard (1951–55) and published in part in 1975,
            Chomsky adopted aspects of Harris’s approach to the study of language and of Goodman’s views on formal systems and the philosophy of science and transformed them into something novel.

                <br />“Plato’s problem”</h3>
                <p>A fundamental insight of philosophical rationalism is that human creativity crucially depends on an innate system of concept generation and combination.
                    According to Chomsky, children display “ordinary” creativity—appropriate and innovative use of complexes of concepts—from virtually their first words.
                    With language, they bring to bear thousands of rich and articulate concepts when they play, invent, and speak to and understand each other.
                    They seem to know much more than they have been taught—or even could be taught.
                    Such knowledge, therefore, must be innate in some sense.
                    To say it is innate, however, is not to say that the child is conscious of it or even that it exists, fully formed, at birth.
                    It is only to say that it is produced by the child’s system of concept generation and combination,
                    in accordance with the system’s courses of biological and physical development, upon their exposure to certain kinds of environmental input.
                    <br />
                    It has frequently been observed that children acquire both concepts and language with amazing facility and speed,
                    despite the paucity or even absence of meaningful evidence and instruction in their early years.
                    The inference to the conclusion that much of what they acquire must be innate is known as the argument from the “poverty of the stimulus.”
                    Specifying precisely what children acquire and how they acquire it are aspects of what Chomsky called in LSLT the “fundamental problem” of linguistics.
                    In later work he referred to this as “Plato’s problem,” a reference to Plato’s attempt (in his dialogue the Meno) to explain how it is possible
                    for an uneducated child to solve geometrical problems with appropriate prompting but without any specific training or background in mathematics.
                    Unlike Plato, however, Chomsky held that solving Plato’s problem is a task for natural science, specifically cognitive science and linguistics.

                <h4>Rule systems in Chomskyan theories of language Chomsky’s </h4>
                <p>
                    Chomsky’s theories of grammar and language are often referred to as “generative,” “transformational,” or “transformational-generative.”
                    In a mathematical sense, “generative” simply means “formally explicit.”
                    In the case of language, however, the meaning of the term typically also includes the notion of “productivity”—i.e.,
                    the capacity to produce an infinite number of grammatical phrases and sentences using only finite means (e.g., a finite number of principles and parameters and a finite vocabulary).
                    In order for a theory of language to be productive in this sense, at least some of its principles or rules must be recursive.
                    A rule or series of rules is recursive if it is such that it can be applied to its own output an indefinite number of times, yielding a total output that is potentially infinite.
                    A simple example of a recursive rule is the successor function in mathematics, which takes a number as input and yields that number plus 1 as output.
                    If one were to start at 0 and apply the successor function indefinitely, the result would be the infinite set of natural numbers.
                    In grammars of natural languages, recursion appears in various forms,
                    including in rules that allow for concatenation, relativization, and complementization, among other operations.
                    <br />
                    Chomsky’s theories are “transformational” in the sense that they account for the syntactic and semantic properties of
                    sentences by means of modifications of the structure of a phrase in the course of its generation.
                    The standard theory of Syntactic Structures and especially of Aspects of the Theory of Syntax employed a phrase-structure grammar—a grammar
                    in which the syntactic elements of a language are defined by means of rewrite rules that specify
                    their smaller constituents (e.g., “S → NP + VP,” or “a sentence may be rewritten as a noun phrase and a verb phrase”)—a large number of “obligatory” and “optional” transformations,
                    and two levels of structure: a “deep structure,” where semantic interpretation takes place, and a “surface structure,” where phonetic interpretation takes place.
                    These early grammars were difficult to contrive, and their complexity and language-specificity made it very difficult to see how they could constitute a solution to Plato’s problem.

                <p>
                    Human conceptual and linguistic creativity involves several mental faculties and entails the existence of some kind of mental organization.
                    It depends on perceptual-articulatory systems and conceptual-intentional systems, of course, but on many others too, such as vision. According to Chomsky,
                    the mind comprises an extensive cluster of innate “modules,” one of which is language. Each module operates automatically,
                    independently of individual control, on the basis of a distinct,
                    domain-specific set of rules that take determinate inputs from some modules and yield determinate outputs for others.
                    In earlier work these operations were called “derivations”; more recently they have been called “computations.”
                    The various modules interact in complex ways to yield perception, thought, and a large number of other cognitive products.
                    <br />
                    The language module seems to play a role in coordinating the products of other modules.
                    The generative—specifically, recursive—properties of language enable humans to combine arbitrary concepts together in indefinitely many ways,
                    thereby making the range of human thought virtually unlimited.
                    When concepts are paired with sounds in lexical items (words), humans can say virtually anything and cooperate and make plans with each other.
                    The fact that the language faculty yields this kind of flexibility suggests that the emergence of language in human evolutionary history coincided with the
                    appearance of other cognitive capacities based on recursion, including quantification.

                <h3 id="Politics">Politics of Noam Chomsky</h3>
                <p>
                    Chomsky’s political views seem to be supported to some extent by his approach to the study of language and mind,
                    which implies that the capacity for creativity is an important element of human nature.
                    Chomsky often notes, however, that there is only an “abstract” connection between his theories of language and his politics.
                    A close connection would have to be based on a fully developed science of human nature, through which fundamental human needs could be identified or deduced.
                    But there is nothing like such a science.
                    Even if there were, the connection would additionally depend on the assumption that the best form of political organization is one that maximizes the satisfaction of human needs.
                    And then there would remain the question of what practical measures should be implemented to satisfy those needs. Clearly, questions such as this cannot be settled by scientific means.

                    Although Chomsky was always interested in politics, he did not become publicly involved in it until 1964, when he felt compelled to lend his voice to protests against the U.S.
                    role in the Vietnam War (or, as he prefers to say, the U.S. invasion of Vietnam), at no small risk to his career and his personal safety.
                    He has argued that the Vietnam War was only one in a series of cases in which the United States used its military power to gain or
                    consolidate economic control over increasingly larger areas of the developing world.
                    In the same vein, he regards the domestic political scene of the United States and other major capitalist countries as theatres in
                    which major corporations and their elite managers strive to protect and enhance their economic privileges and political power.

                    In democracies like the United States, in which the compliance of ordinary citizens cannot be guaranteed by force,
                    this effort requires a form of “propaganda”: the powerful must make ordinary citizens believe that vesting economic control of society in the hands of
                    a tiny minority of the population is to their benefit.
                    Part of this project involves enlisting the help of “intellectuals”—the class of individuals (primarily journalists and academics) who collect,
                    disseminate, and interpret political and economic information for the public. Regrettably, Chomsky argues, this task has proved remarkably easy.

                    As a responsible (rather than mercenary) member of the intellectual class,
                    Chomsky believes that it is his obligation to provide ordinary citizens with the information they needed to draw their own conclusions and
                    to make their own decisions about vital political and economic issues. As he wrote in Powers and Prospects (1996),
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "The responsibility of the writer as a
                        <b><em>moral agent</em></b>
                        is to try to bring the truth about
                        <b><em>matters of human significance</em></b>
                        to
                        <b><em>an audience that can do something about them.</em></b>
                        "
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    In one of his first political essays, “The Responsibility of Intellectuals” (1967), Chomsky presented case after case in which intellectuals in positions of power,
                    including prominent journalists, failed to tell the truth or deliberately lied to the public in order to conceal the aims and consequences of the United States’ involvement in the Vietnam War.
                    In their two-volume work The Political Economy of Human Rights (1979) and later in Manufacturing Consent:
                    The Political Economy of the Mass Media (1988), Chomsky and the economist Edward Herman analyzed the reporting of journalists in
                    the mainstream (i.e., corporate-owned) media on the basis of statistically careful studies of historical and contemporary examples.
                    Their work provided striking evidence of selection, skewing of data, filtering of information, and outright invention in support of assumptions
                    that helped to justify the controlling influence of corporations in U.S. foreign policy and domestic politics.

                    The studies in these and other works made use of paired examples to show how very similar events can be reported in very different ways,
                    depending upon whether and how state and corporate interests may be affected. In The Political Economy of Human Rights, for example,
                    Chomsky and Herman compared reporting on Indonesia’s military invasion and occupation of East Timor with reporting on the behaviour of the communist Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia.
                    The events in the two cases took place in approximately the same part of the world and at approximately the same time (the mid- to late 1970s).
                    As a proportion of population, the number of East Timorese tortured and murdered by the Indonesian military was approximately the same as
                    the number of Cambodians tortured and murdered by the Khmer Rouge.
                    And yet the mainstream media in the United States devoted much more attention to the second case (more than 1,000 column inches in the New York Times)
                    than to the first (about 70 column inches). Moreover, reporting on the actions of the Khmer Rouge contained many clear cases of exaggeration and fabrication,
                    whereas reporting on the actions of Indonesia portrayed them as essentially benign.
                    In the case of the Khmer Rouge, however, exaggerated reports of atrocities aided efforts by the United States to maintain the Cold War
                    and to protect and expand its access to the region’s natural resources (including East Timorese oil deposits) through client states.
                    Indonesia, on the other hand, was just such a state, heavily supported by U.S. military and economic aid.
                    Although ordinary Americans were not in a position to do anything about the Khmer Rouge, they were capable of doing something about their country’s support for Indonesia,
                    in particular by voting their government out of office. But the media’s benign treatment of the invasion made it extremely unlikely that they would be motivated to do so.
                    According to Chomsky, this and many other examples demonstrate that prominent journalists and other intellectuals in the United States
                    function essentially as “commissars” on behalf of elite interests. As he wrote in Necessary Illusions (1988):
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "
                        <b><em>

                            which are closely interlinked,
                            framing their reporting and analysis in a manner supportive of established privilege and limiting debate and discussion accordingly.
                        </em></b>
                        "
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Some of Chomsky’s critics have claimed that his political and media studies portray journalists as actively engaged in a kind of conspiracy—an extremely unlikely conspiracy,
                    of course, given the degree of coordination and control it would require.
                    Chomsky’s response is simply that the assumption of conspiracy is unnecessary.
                    The behaviour of journalists in the mainstream media is exactly what one would expect, on average,
                    given the power structure of the institutions in which they are employed,
                    and it is predictable in the same sense and for the same reasons that the behaviour of the president of General Motors is predictable.
                    In order to succeed—in order to be hired and promoted—media personnel must avoid questioning the interests of the corporations they work for or
                    the interests of the elite minority who run those corporations.
                    Because journalists naturally do not wish to think of themselves as mercenaries (no one does), they engage in what amounts to a form of self-deception.
                    They typically think of themselves as stalwart defenders of the truth (as suggested by the slogan of the New York Times, “All the news that’s fit to print”),
                    but when state or corporate interests are at stake they act otherwise, in crucially important ways.
                    In short, very few of them are willing or even able to live up to their responsibility as intellectuals
                    to bring the truth about matters of human significance to an audience that can do something about them.
